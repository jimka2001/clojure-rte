\begin{frame}{Perspectives}
  Our experiements do not show a direct correlation between aspect-ratio and lossage as we predicted.

  There could be many reasons for this.

  \begin{itemize}
  \item need a better way to measure aspect ratio
  \item secondary effects of RE operations NOT/STAR have more drastic effects that our intuition indicates
  \item RE algebra has more annihilators that numerical arithmetic

  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item PBT often requires AST generation, so we hope our research can be applied far beyond RTE/DFA generation.

  \item Balanced AST generation improves uniformity in the \emph{semantic} space.
  \item Uniform AST generation gives uniformity in the \emph{syntactic} space.
  \item All code publically available: \url{https://github.com/jimka2001/scala-rte}
  \item Project also includes Common Lisp, Clojure, and Python implementations.
  \item Ongoing research to be presented at Clojure Conj \url{2025.clojure-conj.org} (November 2024)
