  "`csv-file-name` is a csv file in the resource/statistics directory

  the write of its argument.  Thereafter, that resulting file is merged (via sort -m) into
  the csv-file in the resource directory. Recall, sort -m, expect the file(s) to already
  be in sorted order.
  It is safe to call this function simultaneously from two different threads or
  two different processes because the manipulation of the resource file is managed
  by `util/call-in-block`"
