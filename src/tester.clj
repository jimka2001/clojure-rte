  unary-test-fun is a unary function which can be called with the return value of
     arg-generator as sole argument.   If the function returns, it is deemed successful.
     If the function needs to indicate failure, it should throw an exception as if by
     (assert false \"some error message\").
  arg-generator is called num-tries number of times to generate input for
  num-tries number of calls to function unary-test-fun.
  gen-components is currently unused, but in the future will be used to simplify expression
      to attempt to generate a simpler test case, if test fails.
  verbose indicates whether to print verbose information about progression of tests."
