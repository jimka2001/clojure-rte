(defn build-state-map
  "This is a helper function for use in `gen-dfa` and is not intended
  for general-purpose use.
  `transitions` is a list of triples of the form [origin-index type-designator target-index]
  We generate a map index->State as needed for the :states argument of map->Dfa.
  However, the given transitions might not specify non-deterministic transitions.
  Therefore we produce a new set of transitions that are deterministic.
  E.g., if we have ([0 x 1]
                    [0 y 2]
                    [0 z 3])
  Then we produce ([0 x 1]
                   [0 (:and y (:not x)) 2]
                   [0 (:and z (:not (:or x y)))])
  Sometimes this :and/:not intersection creates a type designator which is know
  to be vacuous, in which case the transition is omitted.
  For this reason the number of transitions might be reduced,
  and the number of transitions requested in the call to `gen-dfa`
  will fail to be satisfied.
